				{
					"question": "What types of materials can AI automatically generate questions from?",
					"answer": "We support question generation from text input, voice input (reading aloud using a microphone), and image files (text extraction via OCR). Text from PDF files can also be used via copy and paste as text input."
				},
				{
					"question": "What is the FSRS algorithm? How does it help with learning?",
					"answer": "FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) is an algorithm that calculates optimal review timing based on scientific forgetting curve theory, tailored to each user's memory retention. Our application uses this algorithm to automatically suggest efficient review schedules that help learned content stick in long-term memory."
				},
				{
					"question": "What can I do with the note feature?",
					"answer": "Besides easily recording unfamiliar words or content during study, you can generate AI drafts (Premium plan), organize with tags, link notes bidirectionally for knowledge association, and attach images and files. This supports multifaceted knowledge organization and deepening."
				},
				{
					"question": "What are the main differences between Free and Premium plans?",
					"answer": "The Free plan has limitations on AI question generation frequency, number of decks/cards, and note creation. Some advanced features (AI note assist, detailed sharing settings, ad-free) are only available in the Premium plan. See the Pricing page for detailed feature comparison."
				},
				{
					"question": "Is there a free trial for the Premium plan?",
					"answer": "Yes, we offer a 14-day free trial for first-time Premium plan users. During the trial, you can use all Premium features. After the trial ends, you'll automatically be moved to the Free plan (no automatic billing)."
				},
